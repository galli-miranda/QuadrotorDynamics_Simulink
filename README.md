# QuadrotorDynamics_Simulink
Final Project for the Aerospacial Engineering course @ Universidade Federal do ABC (Brazil)
This final paper is a study of PID simulation, quadrotor dynamics and the comparison between 2 actuator strategies. 
Comments, discussions, eventual corrections and improvement suggestions are definetly welcome!
